# 743. Network Delay Time - Best Practices of LeetCode Solutions
LeetCode link: [743. Network Delay Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time), difficulty: **Medium**.

## LeetCode description of "743. Network Delay Time"
You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given node `k`. Return _the **minimum** time it takes for all the n nodes to receive the signal_. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

### [Example 1]
![](../../images/examples/743_1.png)

**Input**: `times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], n = 4, k = 2`

**Output**: `2`

### [Example 2]
**Input**: `times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 1`

**Output**: `1`

### [Example 3]
**Input**: `times = [[1,2,1]], n = 2, k = 2`

**Output**: `-1`

### [Constraints]
- `1 <= k <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= times.length <= 6000`
- `times[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
- `ui != vi`
- `0 <= wi <= 100`
- All the pairs `(ui, vi)` are **unique**. (i.e., no multiple edges.)

### [Hints]
<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  We visit each node at some time, and if that time is better than the fastest time we've reached this node, we travel along outgoing edges in sorted order. Alternatively, we could use Dijkstra's algorithm.
</details>

## Intuition
We can solve it via both **Bellman-Ford algorithm** and **Dijkstra's algorithm**.

### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
Here is an animation about _Bellman-Ford algorithm_:

![](../../images/graph_Bellman-Ford_algorithm_animation.gif)

* `Bellman-Ford algorithm` has less code and can handle the situation of **negative** edge weights, but it is slower than `Dijkstra's algorithm` if it is not optimized.
The following code will introduce how to optimize.

* `Dijkstra's algorithm` always takes the shortest path, so it is more efficient, but it requires writing more code and it cannot handle the situation of **negative** edge weights.

For a detailed description of **Dijkstra's algorithm**, please refer to [1514. Path with Maximum Probability](../1001-2000/1514-path-with-maximum-probability.md).

## Complexity
**V**: vertex count, **E**: Edge count.

### Bellman-Ford algorithm
* Time: `O(V * E)`.
* Space: `O(V)`.

### Queue-improved Bellman-Ford algorithm (also known as `Shortest Path Faster Algorithm` abbreviated as `SPFA`)
* Time: `O(V * X)` (`X` < `E`).
* Space: `O(V + E)`.

### Dijkstra's algorithm using `heap sort`
* Time: `O(E * log(E))`.
* Space: `O(V + E)`.

## Python
### Bellman-Ford algorithm (slow, yet below, I will introduce how to improve its efficiency)
```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, edges: List[List[int]], n: int, start_node: int) -> int:
        min_times = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        min_times[start_node] = 0

        for _ in range(n - 1):
            for source_node, target_node, time in edges: # process edges directly
                if min_times[source_node] == float('inf'):
                    continue

                target_time = time + min_times[source_node]

                if target_time < min_times[target_node]:
                    min_times[target_node] = target_time

        result = max(min_times[1:])

        if result == float('inf'):
            return -1

        return result
```

A very similar question: [787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](./787-cheapest-flights-within-k-stops.md), but if you use the above code, it will not be accepted by LeetCode.

You can try to solve `787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops` first, then read on.

```python
class Solution:
    def networkDelayTime(self, edges: List[List[int]], n: int, start_node: int) -> int:
        min_times = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        min_times[start_node] = 0

        for _ in range(n - 1):
            # If you remove the next line and always use `min_times`, it can also be accepted.
            # But if you print `min_times`, you may see different result. Please try it.
            # The values of `min_times` modified in this loop will affect the subsequent `min_times` items in the same loop.
            # Please work on `problem 787`: https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/ to better understand this. 
            min_times_clone = min_times.copy() # addition 1

            for source_node, target_node, time in edges: # process edges directly
                if min_times_clone[source_node] == float('inf'): # change 1
                    continue

                target_time = time + min_times_clone[source_node] # change 2

                if target_time < min_times[target_node]:
                    min_times[target_node] = target_time

        result = max(min_times[1:])

        if result == float('inf'):
            return -1

        return result
```

### A variant of Bellman-Ford algorithm, which can be used to improve the efficiency of Bellman-Ford algorithm below

        min_times = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        min_times[start_node] = 0
        node_to_pairs = defaultdict(set)

        for source, target, time in edges: # process nodes first, then their edges
            node_to_pairs[source].add((target, time))

        for _ in range(n - 1):
            for node, min_time in enumerate(min_times): # process nodes first
                if min_time == float('inf'):
                    continue

                for target_node, time in node_to_pairs[node]: # process edges of the node
                    target_time = time + min_time

                    if target_time < min_times[target_node]:
                        min_times[target_node] = target_time

        result = max(min_times[1:])

        if result == float('inf'):
            return -1

        return result
```

        for source, target, time in edges: # process nodes first, then their edges
            node_to_pairs[source].add((target, time))

        updated_nodes = set([start_node]) # added 1

        for _ in range(n - 1):
            nodes = updated_nodes.copy() # added 3
            updated_nodes.clear() # added 4

            for node in nodes: # changed 1
                for target_node, time in node_to_pairs[node]: # process edges of the node
                    target_time = time + min_times[node]

                        min_times[target_node] = target_time
                        updated_nodes.add(target_node) # added 2

        result = max(min_times[1:])

        if result == float('inf'):
            return -1

                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (target_time, target_node))

        result = max(min_times[1:])

        if result == float('inf'):
