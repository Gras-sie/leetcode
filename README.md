# A best practice for the LeetCode problems
There are more than 3300 questions on LeetCode. If you do it without any choice, **you won't have that much time**.
**You often find that you can't do the questions you did last time.** This is because you haven't mastered the problem-solving patterns.
When you use several common problem-solving patterns to solve problems, you find that your problem-solving ability has risen to a new level.

Here, I will provide you with **common problem-solving patterns** so that you don't waste time on questions that are not often tested in interviews.

I will also provide you with solutions for many common programming languages, such as **Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, C#, Go, Ruby**, etc.
I have tried my best to write the most concise and efficient code, so I call it my best practice. If you have better solutions, welcome to create an issue or PR!

## How to use this repo?
I have planned a learning route for you. You just need to do the questions in the order they are listed.

Generally speaking, the simple questions are placed at the front, and the dependencies between the questions are also considered reasonably.
After finishing one category of questions, you can study another category to improve your sense of achievement and learning speed.
